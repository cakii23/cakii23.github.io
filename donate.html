      <p>DONATE NOW! SAVE CHILDREN'S LIVES AND HELP END HUNGER. After decades of decline, hunger rates are growing. The devastating effects of COVID-19, extreme weather, and conflict are pushing millions of children and families to the brink. Researchers say child mortality could rise for the first time in 60 years. We must act now before it's too late. With your help, we can save lives. Will you join us?</p>
      <br/><p>Make a gift to help struggling seniors Every day, millions of older adults are forced to choose between paying for heat … or medicine … or nutritious food. More than 37 million seniors are already living in poverty or just one life event away from slipping into it.  Our Foundation is investing in bold, innovative programs — from fighting senior hunger to providing job training to helping older adults connect with their neighbors and communities. Your voluntary donation to our Foundation, our charitable affiliate, is a gift of hope for seniors who may feel forgotten and without options. For seniors struggling to meet their basic needs, your gift is a lifeline.</p>
      <br/><p>Donate Now. Help End Hunger. Every dollar you give to support our advocacy helps Bread for the World secure hundreds of dollars in lifesaving assistance for families in the United States and around the world. Your gift today will help hold Congress accountable to address the economic and health effects of the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>
      <br/><p>Your donation will make a huge difference! Your contributions are even more critical in these unprecedented times. Undernourished children are more susceptible to infectious diseases like COVID-19. The pandemic and its economic impact will leave 265 million people on the brink of starvation worldwide.</p>
      <br/><p>Give now to help change lives Around the world, men, women and children are facing enormous obstacles – like extreme poverty, natural disaster, conflict-driven displacement and now, a global pandemic. Thankfully, you can help people around the world survive and build better lives.  Please make a gift today to our Where Most Needed Fund. Your gift can help us deliver lifesaving assistance to Syrian children displaced by violent conflict, reach hurricane survivors in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, provide families in DR Congo access to clean water, help farmers prepare for the economic consequences of COVID-19 and so much more. Your kindness can help empower families to create a brighter future.</p>
