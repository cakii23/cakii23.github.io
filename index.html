<body><h1><u> My Favourite Sport- Swimming</u>
</h1>
<p> Swimming is my favourite sport. I enjoy it a lot.
Swimming is a sport which almost everyone enjoys on a hot summer day, yet not many people know much about the details of competitive swimming.
I shall give some information about the sport so as to help people understand the sport better.
I have also inserted some useful links in this article for those seeking more information on the different strokes.
