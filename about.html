    <p>One of the greatest problems in the world today is hunger. While many of us enjoy the pleasures of cooking satisfying meals at home as well as dining out, there are millions of people—many of them children—in America and around the world that do not get enough to eat. The good thing is that this problem is fixable; by getting involved locally and donating our volunteering at your city's food bank or soup kitchen, as well as giving to larger charities, you can make a difference. These 10 organizations are safe choices when looking to make charitable donations to fight hunger.</p>
    <br/><p>Action Against Hunger has been committed to ending world hunger for nearly 40 years spanning almost 50 countries. Continuously exploring how to solve the hunger problem, the organization saves the lives of children and their families through detection, prevention, and treatment, particularly after a disaster strikes.</p>
    <br/><p>Our Charity Aims to End the World Hunger.</p>
